# ChatGPT and future of ChatBots
  A couple of days ago, ChatGPT has been released by OpenAI. ChatGPT is a chatbot based on GPT-3.5 which uses a deep learning model to create text like a human-being. As we see on social media or on other sources, this bot can respond to the questions meaningfully, It can fix codes or write codes or can pretend like someone else and so much other things. This machine has been learning day by day and OpenAI proceeds to develop this bot as well. They will be helpful for coding and they will ease the jobs. It could decrease job opportunities for developers a little, but it is not expected that AI can replace the developers in the near future. In the future, the majority of people will have them like robot cleaners and there won’t be only ChatGPT, there will be various chatbot robots or something else that uses chatbots. We will talk to bots instead of people. And there will be no limit to adding functions to robots by using AI — Image Processing, etc.



  On the other hand, there might be various disadvantages in adding functionalities to them. Each functionality could be used for the opposite power to people. AI can be used as a hack tool, or AI directly can be hackable. Therefore, if AI and chatbots grow uncontrollably and rapidly, there could be come out security vulnerabilities which might come up with terrible consequences. Their use in war is the most deadly consequence.
